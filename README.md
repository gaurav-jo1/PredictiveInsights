# PredictiveInsights
Predictive Analytics for Business: A project leveraging PyTorch to develop machine learning models that forecast future sales, revenue, and customer behavior based on historical data. Includes regression techniques for continuous predictions like sales forecasting and classification methods for understanding customer patterns.

# Steps to Build the Dataset

## 1. Identify the Data Sources

**Sales Data:** Includes transaction records, order details, and revenue per order.

**Customer Data:** Demographics, purchase history, browsing history, and preferences.

**External Data:** Economic indicators, holidays, promotions, and weather data (if applicable).

## 2.Define Key Features
**Time-Based Features:** Date, time, seasonality indicators (e.g., month, quarter, holiday).

**Sales Metrics:** Units sold, total revenue, discounts offered.

**Customer Features:** Age, gender, loyalty level, region, average purchase value.

**Behavioral Data:** Frequency of purchases, average time between purchases, categories browsed.

## 3.Collect and Clean Data

### Data Collection:
* Use tools like APIs to fetch sales data from platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, or POS systems.
* Gather customer information from CRM tools.
* Scrape or download external datasets (e.g., economic indicators or weather data).

### Cleaning:
* Handle missing values with techniques like imputation or by discarding incomplete rows.
* Normalize numerical features (e.g., scaling sales values to a 0â€“1 range).
* Encode categorical data (e.g., one-hot encoding for regions or product categories).

## 4. Combine and Format the Dataset
* Use Pandas to merge data from different sources based on keys like `Customer ID`, `Date`, or `Order ID`.
* Ensure the dataset is in a tabular format suitable for ML models, with columns for features and the target variable.

## 5. Feature Engineering
### Create new features to enhance the dataset:
* Lag Features: Past sales figures (e.g., sales last week or month).
* Rolling Averages: Average revenue over a sliding window of time.
* Cumulative Features: Lifetime customer value or total revenue.


# Tools for Dataset Preparation
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation.
* **SQL:** For querying data from relational databases.
* **APIs:** For fetching data from external platforms.
* **Google Sheets / Excel:** For basic preprocessing and data inspection.
